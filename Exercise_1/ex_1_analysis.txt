We implemented three different algoritms for part one. These were (1+1) EA, RLS and the same genetic algorithm that
was used in the previous assignment 2. These algorithms were tested with three different types of problems, these
being MaxCoverage, MaxInfluence, and PackWhileTravel. For the MaxCoverage problems it was noted that the (1+1) EA
performed better than both RLS and the GA. (1+1) EA performed slightly slower than the RLS algorithm but it would
overtake the RLS algorithm and provide a better result. The genetic algorithm was slowest but would eventually peak 
with a similar results to that of the (1+1) EA. For the MaxInfluence problem the RLS performed better than the (1+1)
EA but only marginally better. Both algorithms got very similar average final results and worked at similar speeds.
The genetic algorithm very much struggled with this problem and performed very poorly. It achieved average results
approximately half that of both RLS and (1+1) EA. The genetic algorithm could have most likely been greatly improved
but needing to use the same algorithm from the previous assignment meant this was not possible. Results did differ
for the three PackWhileTravel problems. For problem 2300, (1+1) EA peaked first and was shortly followed by RLS. Unlike
the previous problems though the GA actaully provided a better value than the other algorithms, it just took it longer
to get going. For problem 2301, RLS peaks first followed by (1+1) EA. This time the genetic algorithm also got much
better results but came in second, behing RLS. Finally, for problem 2302, (1+1) EA performs the best followed by RLS.
Unlike the previous PackWhileTravel problems the GA performs very badly and does not get results close to either of the 
other algorithms. Looking at all these results I think it is clear that both RLS and (1+1) EA are solid algorithms to use
for either of these problems. A genetic algorithm most likely could work very well for all of these, I just believe
the algorithm created in assignment 2 was not up to standard and if we had been able to make our own rather than recycling
our old algorithm it would have performed much better.
