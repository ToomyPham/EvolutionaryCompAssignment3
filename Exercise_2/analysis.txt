After implementing the code, the algorithm was tested and left to collect data for all the the MaxCoverage and MaxInfluence ploblems.
The data was then plotted for analysis and shows that the MaxCoverage displayed a consistant exponential growth and showed a steep curve 
when the number of selected nodes were between 0 - 4. This shows that adding nodes gives large gains in coverage and displays a strong
marginal return. Between 5-7 selected nodes, the improvement begins to slow down and begin showing deminishing returns. After 8 onwards,
the GSEMO was reaching the optimal region where the function began to converge. The MaxInfluence showed a similar trade-off plot to the
MaxCoverage. Although the MaxInfluence had a much greater objective value increase early on and began to have a slower and consistant
increase after 1. MaxInfluence all displayed exponential growth but rather a fast growth in the beginning and almost a linear growth after
some time. The PWT shows also an exponential growth but a rather sharp and quick drop off in returns around 9 selected nodes for the 2300 PWT.
The PWT 2301 displayed a very linear growth, suggesting a balanced trade-off between value and travel cost, therefore linearly proportional to
one another. the PWT 2302 shows two distinct linear clusters of points, suggesting that the two regions of data are seperated from an suboptimal
zone, indicating the presence of a conflicting objective, where nether light or heavy solutions are good.
